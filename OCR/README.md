Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a widely used task that has applications in various domains. Although initially designed to aid individuals with vision impairments, its modern use has expanded to a much broader audience. The objective of OCR is to take an input image and produce raw text that retains the original structure of the text present in the image. In essence, it aims to preserve the formatting features such as line breaks and paragraph segmentation that exist in the original text on the page.
